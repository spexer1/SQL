## Second training example prompt: With our upgraded grocery list table down below, we are tasked now with figuring out how many items we in total need to buy in our 
cart, and are thus shown how to aggregate the data for this task.

CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 56, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(2, "Peanut Butter", 1, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(3, "Dark Chocolate Bars", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(4, "Ice cream", 1, 12);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(5, "Cherries", 6, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(6, "Chocolate syrup", 1, 4);


--To start our query over the total number of items, we'll start with the SELECT command, then the aggregate function SUM() with name of the row we want (quantity), 
and then FROM (table name groceries), which overall lead to the below example. 

SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle;

SELECT MAX(quantity) FROM groceries;

--Additional practice in using the sum command in a metaphorical todo list.

CREATE TABLE todo_list (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, minutes INTEGER);
INSERT INTO todo_list VALUES (1, "Wash the dishes", 15);
INSERT INTO todo_list VALUES (2, "vacuuming", 20);
INSERT INTO todo_list VALUES (3, "Learn some stuff on KA", 30);
INSERT INTO todo_list VALUES (4, "reading", 35);


SELECT SUM(minutes) FROM todo_list;
