# Spencer T. Harvey's SQL Portofolio ðŸ¥³ (Confetti)

## Hello and welcome to my SQL Portfolio of all my little projects, you are probably incredibly busy and are wondering what you will be finding from my page?

So I hope it would not be out of the question to speak on what to expect to see here?

This code repository contains examples of my SQL journey that I have written and listed here. I am really impressed with my journey through SQL, from jumping off of other coding languages, and want to document my professional development here.

Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions (I appeciate you stopping by), as I am sure we can have a lot to talk about if you want to chat:
