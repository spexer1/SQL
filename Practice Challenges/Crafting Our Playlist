--Our first step of this practice is to select the title of all the songs by the artist named 'Queen',
    
SELECT title FROM songs where artist = "Queen";

--Following this to make a 'Pop' playlist, we selected the name of all of the artists from the 'Pop' genre
SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop";

--To finish up creating the 'Pop' playlist, the practice challeng was to make another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists. 
This would use the 'IN' operator on for a subquery.


SELECT title FROM songs where artist IN ( SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop");
