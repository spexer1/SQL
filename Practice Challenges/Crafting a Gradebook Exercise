/** This particular exercise is something more challenging as this time we've created a database in order to track student grades, with their name, number grade, 
and what percent of activities they've completed. The steps for this challenge will reflect our current understaning of the 'CASE' function **/


CREATE TABLE student_grades (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    number_grade INTEGER,
    fraction_completed REAL);
    
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winston", 90, 0.805);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winnefer", 95, 0.901);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winsteen", 85, 0.906);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Wincifer", 66, 0.7054);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winster", 76, 0.5013);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winstonia", 82, 0.9045);


--The first of our queries is to start by selecting all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed. The last displayed name will be done 
from changing the fraction__completed column by converting the entries to whole numbers through multiplication.

SELECT name, number_grade, ROUND(fraction_completed * 100) AS percent_completed 
 FROM student_grades; 

--Now our final query will be converting our above table to show how many students have earned which letter_grade. As you will see below this can be done by using 
CASE with the number_grade column and changing the displayed name to lettr_grade, and outputting 
'A' for grades > 90, 
'B' for grades > 80, 
'C' for grades > 70, 
and 'F' otherwise. 

/**CASE**/ 
SELECT COUNT(*),
    CASE
        WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN "A"
        WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN "B"
        WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN "C"
        ELSE "F"
    END AS "letter_grade"
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY letter_grade
