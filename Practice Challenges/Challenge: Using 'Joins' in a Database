/**For this challeng regarding our understanding of 'JOIN' queries so far, we've created a database of people and hobbies, where the table 'hobbies'
and the table 'persons' are related via the persons ID. To become familiar with this concept we will join these two tables in some queries that would seemlessly
extract the person's name next to their expressed hobby.**/

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Bobby McBobbyFace", 12);

INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Shish Kabob", 20);

--To begin finding what we want we will 'SELECT' the 2 tables with an 'EXPLICIT INNER JOIN' to combine our results, 
SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons 
JOIN hobbies 
ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id;

--Our query found the results that we would have wanted if we wanted to see what each person would have listed as their hobby, but if we were say requested to find a
specific person from our list needing to be recalled quickly, how would we do that? That was what we wanted to try finding out from this result as well, 
SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons
JOIN hobbies
ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id
WHERE persons.name = "Bobby McBobbyFace";
